1) package manager page. using home brew we list most of the improtant packages like python java the packages,
so users can easily install them in one click. 
 -- they should also able to select which version they wanna install. we show them all avaliable version that can be installed.
2) but if the page is clicked. we should detect if homebrew is installed, if not install it, then run
all the improtant homebrew commands like upgrade, doctor, cleanup etc etc.

to see all the necessaey packages look at packages.txt
